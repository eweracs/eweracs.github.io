        Hi, I&rsquo;m Sebastian Carewe. I am a font engineer, type designer and linguist currently based in Paris.<br>
        Initially from Berlin, Germany, I studied interface design and focused on type design under Luc(as) de Groot.
        After studying Italian language and literature for a year, I moved to Porto, Portugal, to work as a font
        engineer at <a href="https://schriftlabor.at">Schriftlabor</a> for one year. Owing to my passion for
        languages, I then completed a BA in linguistics in Lille and am continuing with a master&rsquo;s degree in
        Paris.<br>
        I publish scripts and plugins for Glyphs and various other code on my <a href="https://github.com/eweracs">
        Github</a>. I pride myself in a most comprehensive type design skill set ranging all the way from drawing to
        the nitty-gritty final production work. Equally balancing drawing, tool creation and production has enabled
        me to inform each of these fields to develop a highly efficient workflow which compromises neither quality
        nor adaptability.<br>
        Aside from type, I have a broad background in music, with a keen interest in music theory, acoustics and the
        piano (jazz and classical). I spend my time speed-skating in winter and on my bike in summer. I can solve a
        Rubik&rsquo;s cube in nine seconds, but can&rsquo;t tell you the point.
