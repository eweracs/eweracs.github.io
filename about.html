        Hi, I&rsquo;m Sebastian Carewe. I am a font engineer and type designer currently based in Lille, France.<br>
        While studying interface design in Potsdam, Germany, I focused on type design under Luc(as) de Groot and went on to work on a multitude of projects, from in-house families and remasters to exclusive typefaces. After studying Italian language and literature for a year, I moved to Porto, Portugal, to work as a font engineer at <a href="https://schriftlabor.at"><i>Schriftlabor</i></a> for one year. Owing to my passion for languages, I am currently studying linguistics in Lille.<br> I publish scripts and plugins for Glyphs and various other code on my <a href="https://github.com/eweracs"><i>Github</i></a>. I pride myself in a most comprehensive type design skill set ranging all the way from drawing to the nitty-gritty final production work. Equally balancing drawing, tool creation and production has enabled me to inform each of these fields to develop a highly efficient workflow which compromises neither quality nor adaptability.<br> Aside from type, I have a broad background in music, with a keen interest in music theory, acoustics and the piano (jazz and classical). In winter, I spend my time speed-skating and on my bike in summer. I can solve a Rubik&rsquo;s cube in nine seconds, but can&rsquo;t tell you the point.
